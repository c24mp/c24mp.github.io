        This week I have been working on my website, I have made a backround image in photo shop and implemented it on my website. It was hard trying to get the right dimentions for it and I am still working on it. I did my person card as well in codepen and that went well. I did have some issues on making the journal website. I for some reason couldn't make a 'body' in the head section. I had to coppy and paste the code from my index on to the journal code than delet all the unessary bits. I also don't know how to aline divs in a certan place on the web site so I hope to figure that out at class on Monday.

This week I worked on my first code sketch called buttons. It was fun and I also leared about functions, variable and other JS what not. It was fun also coding like a cat :). I showed my code sketch to my parent and they liked it, they though that it was cool and were impressed with me. My computer broke so now I can code on this chrome book so not as much coding as last time.

I know it’s been along time since my last entry, I totally forgot. The past week I got a loaner laptop (finally) but they were out of chargers. It was an old laptop, the kind with the magnetic snap in, and I have one of those charges at home but it wasn’t the right size. Anyways I had a lab today and am having one tomorrow. I mad good headway on my bike animation project. I can’t wait to go in person on monday.

Since my last entry I have finished my animation project (which you should have a look at) and have also made a forloop. bascicly how a forloop works is that I have a set class for an image with width, height and all the jazz sorted out. then in my java section i have it to run a function every quarter second. this function then adds a duve in my body section and gives that div the class that is pre made. you can see the final product for your self. (this is the basic of a for loop, I added a couple of adjusments like making the margin smaller every time the function runs)

This is my last entrie. curently I am in new hampshire with my family, grands parents too as it is their house. My brother's friend is here too, his name is Jared. Anyways, here is my final reflection, I realy like compsci this year and actualy enjoyed the coding. Before, I despised coding and would activly do anyting that I could to not code. I think that what changed this year was my atatude towards coding. I looked at it in a way where I didn't hate it but acctualy tried to enjoy it, which I did. I think that some of the most fun that I had was showing my family what I had created and seeing how they were impressed. Ultiatly I learded alot in this class and what I will most likely put these skill's to use is in robotics. I realy like building things, like ALOT, and so I hope than with the combination of building and coding I will be able to get into robotics. Obviously I will also use these skills to do compsci 2 (i think that that is what it's called) and inprove my coding skills. I think that being able to code, at least a little bit will be realy helpfull in the future and I hope to progress over time. What I leared this year, I wont go into dept, was a lot. Primaraly, I leared about div's, styling, and other stuff for formating thinks in css. This then gravitated towards the other bascics of css, like background images and positioning. We then started to learn javascript, primarly event listners and then moved on to other stuff. Probably who ever is reading this allready knows what we leared but It just kept incrementing over time. Something that was difucult for me was rembering all the Java words. I constantly kept going back to past codesketches and copying and pasting the difernt lines of code. I realy loved coding this year but the only thing that held me up was unkown errors that I encountered. What I would recomend to future students is to make a lab when you are working on a code sketch. Even if you think that you won't need one, you definatly will. I don't know what else to add, I had a blast in coding this year and I hope to have the same amount of fun next year.
